This was a class project for a computer vision class. I realized that I had hard coded a few parameters to work for the image included. Working on fixing that.
I had virtually no graphics experience when making this, so it is done in OpenCV's viz3D package. Hence the funky controls.

Usage: ./TIP <image>

Click to select the upper left corner of the back wall of the image.
Press enter.
Click the lower right corner of the back wall.
Press enter.
Click to select the vanishing point (guidelines will be displayed to help you get the right one).
Press enter.
(Now it will take a minute to compute the world.)
(You have to click the image for it to update for some reason)
3D world View:
	Drag the display to rotate the view.
	Mousewheel to zoom
	Ctrl+drag to rotate in orthoganal plane
	Shift+drag to move camera
