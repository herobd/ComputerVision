SimpleImageClassifier

Brian Davis
2015

Our first project for CS601R. Uses lots of OpenCV.

This provides several ways of going about the pipeline, the final program will have:
* SIFT or dense feature point extraction
* SIFT or HOG feature point description (with a self implemented version of SIFT)
* Quantization via my own codebook implementation with a hack LLC encoding
* Description of image with spatial pyramids
* Classification with SVM or MKL
